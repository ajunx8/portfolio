            <h2>Software Engineer based in Sydney</h2>
            <br />
            <p>I'm a recent graduate from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course, looking to join a team of out-of-the-box thinkers.</p>
            <p>Before the course, I worked as a Machinist in plastics manufacturing where I learned to take pride and responsibility in the work that I put out. Working in an environment with unpredictable deadlines taught me to work cohesively within a team.</p>
            <p>During that time, I discovered Andrew Ng's online course on Machine learning where I developed analytical thinking and gained a growing interest in programming and algorithms.</p>
            <p>As of September 2022, I'm open to job opportunities so please feel free to <a className="email" href="mailto:adrian.greksa@gmail.com?body=What would you like to say?">email</a> or connect with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriangreksa">LinkedIn</a></p>
